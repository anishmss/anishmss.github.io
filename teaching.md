We live in an age where a motivated student can easily access an abundance of educational materials available online to gain an undergraduate-level understanding of any major discipline. This is undeniably true for computer science and biology as well. However I have learnt that there are many aspects of teaching that can only be realized in actual classrooms and as part of one-to-one mentoring. It is this realization that drives my teaching.

## At DLSU Manila:

- BIOINFO Bioinformatics : Undergraduate-level introductory course on bioinformatics.
- CSC711M/D Bioinformatics: Graduate-level introductory course on bioinformatics.
- CCDSTRU Discrete Structures: Introductory freshman undergrad course on discrete mathematics.
- CCDASLG Data Structures and Algorithms: Introductory undergrad course on data-structures and algorithms.
- CSALGCM: Algorithm and Complexity : Introductory undergrad course on algorithms and intractability.

## At the University of Tokyo:

- Introduction to Bioinformatics, group-taught course for graduate students, 2018
ゲノム配列解析論 (Genome Sequence analysis), group-taught course for undergraduate students in Department of Bioinformatics and System Biology and graduate students of Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, University of Tokyo, 2015, 2016, 2017

- 情報基礎実験, a group-taught lab course in computer science for third-year undergraduate students of the Department of Bioinformatics and System Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Tokyo, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017

- Sequence analysis, a beginner-level introduction to topics in sequence alignment for researchers organized by HPCI.

## At Keio University, Japan

- DATA SCIENCE FOR GENOME DYNAMICS / GENOME INFORMATICS (GIGA), Guest lectures at Keio University Shonan-Fujisawa Campus, 2017, 2021.
