I am an associate professor in the College of Computer Studies at De La Salle University Manila.
I lead the [Bioinformatics Lab](https://www.bioinfodlsu.com), Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing, and Networking (AdRIC), DLSU Manila.

Prior to this, I was an assistant professor at the Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, the University of Tokyo.

I like to work on challenges that bring together biological and computational sciences.
